# CheatDeviceOwnTheCity
A **Cheat Device** (still in progress) made for *Need For Speed Carbon: Own The City*. Only works on US Version v1.00 (**ULUS10114**).

**CheatDevice Own The City v0.13 Changelog**

- Fixed access memory problem, so now it works in PPSSPP "Fast Memory" and real hardware (PSP, Adrenaline)!
- Added a "Exit Game" option, so it's easier to exit the game
- Fixed saving bug

To open the cheat, press **Square + L-Trigger**.

For now this is what you can do with it:

**NOTE:** to use the cheats, navigate through them, only the "Go to Screen", "Set Game Language" and "Exit Game" work for now.

To "activate" those cheats, press X for the "Go to Screen" and "Exit Game" one and O (circle) for the "Set Game Language".
